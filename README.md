# About EcoTip

EcoTip is a web application that gives advice about efficient and better ways to live life. The messages are insightful and serve as a guideline to a healthier, cheaper, and more fulfilling lifestyle.

## User Interface

The frontend is made with React which renders one component called Home (**/frontend/src/components/Home.js**). CSS makes the web page adapt to different screen sizes (**/frontend/src/index.css**).

## Notifications API

The Notifications API interface is a JavaScript API used to configure and display desktop notifications to the user. In this specific application, it is used with the React useState hook to notify users who have turned notifications on in their browserðŸ“².

The code is available in **/frontend/src/components/Home.js** under the function name **notifyUser()**. Every new notification has a title, icon, and body text which is the text from the new notification. The icon is available in **/frontend/public/images/logo.png**
